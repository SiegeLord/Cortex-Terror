3. Building on Windows
======================

Requirements:
	dmd 2.057 compiler .. Can be found at http://ftp.digitalmars.com/dinstaller.exe (select only dmd2 when choosing components)
	Tango-D2 ............ You can grab a copy at https://github.com/SiegeLord/Tango-D2
	DAllegro5 ........... You can grab a copy at https://github.com/SiegeLord/DAllegro5
	Allegro 5.0.5 ....... Grab a pre-built binary copy at http://www.allegro.cc/files/ . Get the MinGW version.

Steps:
	1. Compile Tango-D2 and DAllegro5 by following the directions in their respective readmes.
	2. Use the create_import_libs.bat to create the import library for allegro from allegro-5.0.5-monolith-mt.dll
	3. Copy tango.lib (step 1), dallegro5.lib (step 1), allegro.lib (step 2) into the base folder of this game
	4. Copy the folder tango and dallegro5 from TangoD2 and DAllegro5 sources into the base folder of the game (do NOT just copy the contents of those folders!)
	5. Run the makefile using this command: mingw32-make -f Makefile.win

4. Building on Linux
====================

TODO. Same idea as a above, but you'll need LDC2 for 64 bit builds, and there's no need for step 2.

5. Resource attributions
========================

Most sounds were from http://www.pdsounds.org .

Music is by Zilly Mike from http://modarchive.org . The following shows the mapping between the original filenames and the new filename.

money.xm -> peace.xm
forestofcalm.xm -> medium.xm
mega_destruction.xm -> war.xm

Energon font was found at http://www.dafont.com/energon.font .

The rest was created by yours truly.
